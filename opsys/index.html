	<h1>Distro Recommendations</h1>
	<p>Here are my recommendations for Linux distros.<br>Please note that none of these pages/OSes are<br>related to or created by tredI9100.</p>
	<a href=https://linuxmint.com/>Linux Mint</a>
	<p>An overall great and user-friendly OS. I tried it once on a Thinkpad and I've used it on all my computers since.</p>
	<a href=https://distro.ibiblio.org/fatdog/web/>Fatdog64</a>
	<p>A small and lightweight distro, great for bootable USB drives and CDs.<br>You might have trouble running it on newer PCs though,<br>and updates don't happen very often.</p>
	<a href=https://www.debian.org/>Debian</a>
	<p>A very robust and stable distro that a lot of other distros are based on, like Ubuntu.<br>New releases take a lot of time to be released, but this just means you don't have to upgrade to the new releases as much.</p>
	<br><br><p>More things will be added to this list at some point.</p>
